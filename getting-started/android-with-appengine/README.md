Serverless Kotlin: Getting Started App
===

This sample application, called **Emojify**, demonstrates a Kotlin backend which communicates with a mobile frontend. The backend receives an input image from the frontend and overlays an emoji on each of the detected faces in the image based on facial expressions.

Follow the [Extend an Android frontend with a Kotlin backend running on App Engine](https://g.co/codelabs/emojify) codelab to build and run it yourself!

Example of source and emojified images:
