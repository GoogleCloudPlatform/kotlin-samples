## Description

This sample application demonstrates how to invoke the [Google Cloud Storage API][storage-api-docs] from Kotlin.

The app is a command-line tool that implements the following Google Cloud Storage operations:

1. Create a bucket
2. List buckets 
3. List blobs in a bucket
4. Upload a file to a bucket
5. Download a blob from a bucket
6. Delete a blob
7. Delete a bucket

Examples:
```sh 
java -jar build/libs/storage.jar create my_awesome_bucket
```
```sh 
java -jar build/libs/storage.jar upload resources/upload/dog.jpg my_awesome_bucket
```

## Project Setup

### Enabling Cloud Storage API

Follow this **[link][enable-storage-api]** to enable the **Cloud Storage API** within an existing Google Cloud project or in a new project.

### Setting up authentication

For the [Google
Cloud Storage API][storage-api-docs] to work, you must first setup **[authentication](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production)** by creating a service account key.

1. After enabling the Cloud Vision API, [Go to credentials][create-creds] and click **Create credentials**.
2. From the **Create credentials** drop-down list, select **Service account key**.
3. From the **Service account** drop-down list, select **New service account**.
4. Choose a name for your Service account.
4. Select an appropriate role for your service account (the sample should work even when no role is set).
5. Select **JSON** Key type and click **Create**. Note: if you didn't select any role, a warning will appear. In this case, click **Create without role**.
6. A JSON file that contains your credentials will be **downloaded to your computer**.

### Setting GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS

Set the environment variable **GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS** to the path of the JSON file downloaded previously.

**Note:** This variable only applies to your current shell session, so if you open a new session, you might need to set the variable again.

* Linux or macOS: 
```sh
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service_account_key.json
```
* Windows: 

   With command prompt:
   ```sh
   set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS= /path/to/service_account_key.json
   ```
   With PowerShell:
   ```sh
   $env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS= '/path/to/service_account_key.json'
   ```
### Cloning the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kotlin-samples
cd kotlin-samples/storage
```
### Installing dependencies with Gradle

**Build the project with Gradle Wrapper** using the gradlew build command:
```sh
# run with "-info" flag to print potential errors
./gradlew build -info
```
You should now have a **'storage.jar'** file under **build/libs/**
## Running the sample

You can run Google Cloud Storage actions by supplying any of the below commands to the **storage.jar** file:

### usage

Prints syntax of commands implemented in the sample
```sh 
java -jar build/libs/storage.jar usage
```
### create

Creates a new bucket
```sh 
java -jar build/libs/storage.jar create <bucket>
```
### info

Gives details about a bucket or a blob
* To list all buckets in your storage
  ```sh 
  java -jar build/libs/storage.jar info
  ```
* To list all blobs in a bucket
  ```sh 
  java -jar build/libs/storage.jar info <bucket>
  ```
### upload
 
Uploads a file to a bucket
*  Letting the program infer blob name from **localFilePath**
   ```sh 
   java -jar build/libs/storage.jar upload <localFilePath> <bucket>
   ```
*  Providing blob name
   ```sh 
   java -jar build/libs/storage.jar upload <localFilePath> <bucket> <blob>
   ```  
### download

Downloads a blob from a bucket to your computer
```sh 
java -jar build/libs/storage.jar download <bucket> <blob> <localFilePath>
```
### delete

Deletes a bucket or a blob
* To delete a bucket
  ```sh 
  java -jar build/libs/storage.jar delete <bucket>
  ```
* To delete a blob
  ```sh 
  java -jar build/libs/storage.jar delete <bucket> <blob>
  ```

## Using IntelliJ IDE
You can simply **open** the project in IntelliJ.

## The client library

This sample uses the [Google Cloud Client Library for Java][google-cloud-java].
You can read the documentation for more details on API usage and use GitHub
to [browse the source][google-cloud-java-source] and
[report issues][google-cloud-java-issues].

## Troubleshooting
 * **"Failed to detect whether we are running on Google ComputeEngine"**; **"The Application Default Credentials are not available"**: If you get these errors, make sure you set the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to a path to your service account credentials. If you don't already have service account credentials, you will need to
[create them][create-creds]. 

 * If you get any **"Permission denied"** error, make sure you enabled billing for your Google Cloud project. 
 
 * **IntelliJ:** If you get this error: *"...the provided plugin org.jetbrains.kotlin.scripting.compiler.plugin.Scripting CompilerConfiguration ComponentRegistrar is not compatible with this version of compiler"*, **manually update your IDE Kotlin Plugin**.
