## Description

This sample application demonstrates how to invoke the [Google Cloud Storage API][storage-api-docs] from Kotlin.

The app is a command-line tool that implements the following Google Cloud Storage operations:

1. Create a bucket
2. List buckets 
3. List blobs in a bucket
4. Upload a file to a bucket
5. Download a blob from a bucket
6. Delete a blob
7. Delete a bucket

Examples:
```sh 
java -jar build/libs/storage.jar create my_awesome_bucket
```
```sh 
java -jar build/libs/storage.jar upload resources/upload/dog.jpg my_awesome_bucket
```

## Quickstart

#### Setup
- [Enable][enable-storage-api] Storage API.
- Set up [authentication](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started).

#### Build
- Clone the repository
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kotlin-samples
  cd kotlin-samples/storage
  ```
- Build the project with Gradle Wrapper:
  ```sh
  # run with "-info" flag to print potential errors
  ./gradlew build -info
  ```
You should now have a **'storage.jar'** file under **build/libs/**

#### Running the sample

You can run Google Cloud Storage actions by supplying any of the below commands to the **storage.jar** file:

#### usage

Prints syntax of commands implemented in the sample
```sh 
java -jar build/libs/storage.jar usage
```
#### create

Creates a new bucket
```sh 
java -jar build/libs/storage.jar create <bucket>
```
#### info

Gives details about a bucket or a blob
* To list all buckets in your storage
  ```sh 
  java -jar build/libs/storage.jar info
  ```
* To list all blobs in a bucket
  ```sh 
  java -jar build/libs/storage.jar info <bucket>
  ```
#### upload
 
Uploads a file to a bucket
*  Letting the program infer blob name from **localFilePath**
   ```sh 
   java -jar build/libs/storage.jar upload <localFilePath> <bucket>
   ```
*  Providing blob name
   ```sh 
   java -jar build/libs/storage.jar upload <localFilePath> <bucket> <blob>
   ```  
#### download

Downloads a blob from a bucket to your computer
```sh 
java -jar build/libs/storage.jar download <bucket> <blob> <localFilePath>
```
#### delete

Deletes a bucket or a blob
* To delete a bucket
  ```sh 
  java -jar build/libs/storage.jar delete <bucket>
  ```
* To delete a blob
  ```sh 
  java -jar build/libs/storage.jar delete <bucket> <blob>
  ```
