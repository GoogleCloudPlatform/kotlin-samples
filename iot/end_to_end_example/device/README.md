- [Rainbow Hat for Android Things](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/rainbow-hat-for-android-things) or the following individual components:
    - 1 [bmp280 temperature sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2651)
    - 1 [segment display with I2C backpack](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1270)
    - 1 push button
    - 1 resistor
    - jumper wires
    - 1 breadboard

    - (optional) [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) project

## Build and install

On Android Studio, click on the "Run" button.
If you prefer to run on the command line, type
```bash
./gradlew installDebug
adb shell am start com.example.androidthings.weatherstation/.WeatherStationActivity
```

If you have everything set up correctly:
- The segment display will show the current "temperature" which will increase with the heater on and decrease with the heater off.
- If a APA102 RGB Led strip is connected, it will display a rainbow of 7 pixels indicating the "heater" state.
